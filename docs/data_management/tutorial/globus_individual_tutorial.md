## How to transfer data between LTS and Cheaha?

You can transfer data between LTS and Cheaha using Globus. To do this, select the LTS collection on one side and the Cheaha collection on the other side in the transfer panel interface, and authenticate the identity.

To transfer data from LTS to Cheaha, make sure the paths are correctly set on both ends by navigating to the appropriate folders. Select the files or folders from the LTS side and click the "Start" button on the left-hand side panel. The data will be transferred and will appear in the right-hand side panel, which corresponds to the Cheaha end.
