# UAB Cloud

Our [cloud.rc](https://dashboard.cloud.rc.uab.edu) portal, based on [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) cloud software, provides a home for more permanent research applications such as web pages and database hosting, as well as a place where researchers can more fluidly develop applications for high performance compute.

Resource quotas are set to ensure that every researcher has a fair share. Please be sure to free up resources when they are no longer needed by deleting instances and volumes.

Currently, access to cloud.rc must be made while on campus or on the campus Virtual Private Network (VPN). For more information about using the VPN, please visit [VPN - UAB IT](https://www.uab.edu/it/home/tech-solutions/network/vpn).

To get started using cloud.rc, please navigate to <https://dashboard.cloud.rc.uab.edu/>. A view of the dashboard is shown below.

Cloud.rc runs on Openstack. If you are new to Openstack or to cloud.rc, it is highly recommended to follow our tutorial to learn how to set up all of the necessary components of a virtual machine (VM) setup. In the tutorial we cover:

1. [Networks](network_setup_basic.md)
2. [Security Policies](security_setup_basic.md)
3. [Instances](instance_setup_basic.md)
4. [Volumes](volume_setup_basic.md) (optional)

The tutorial is intended to be followed in this order. Doing it out of order may result in errors and issues. If you encounter any unexpected issues, unclear instructions or have questions or comments, please contact [Support](../help/support.md). Otherwise, feel free to start the tutorial with [Networks](network_setup_basic.md).
